% The psychofit toolbox contains a couple of tools that can be used to fit psychometric data.
% The fitting is done using maximal likelihood estimation: one assumes that the responses of the
% subject are given by a binomial distribution whose mean is given by the psychometric function.
%
% Functions that can be used for fitting are 'weibull' and 'erf_psycho'.
% If your data goes from 0.5 to 1, use 'weibull50'
